Information
-----------

*CrSFML* is a library that allows you to use [SFML][] with Crystal. [SFML][] is a library written in C++, but it has official bindings to C, called [CSFML][], which is what *CrSFML* actually provides bindings to.

[CSFML][] 2.3, which requires [SFML][] 2.3, must be installed to use *CrSFML* (see older releases for 2.2).

[Information on contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) + implementation details.

*CrSFML* has been tested on Linux 64-bit. It should work on other major systems if Crystal supports them.

*Audio* and *Network* modules are considered experimental. Expect some rough edges.
